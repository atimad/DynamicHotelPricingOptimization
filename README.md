# Dynamic Hotel Pricing Optimization

### Project Goal
This project explores how to build a **trading floor-inspired, real-time dynamic pricing engine** for hotel inventory.

The system leverages:
- Advanced **demand forecasting** models
- **Price elasticity modeling** under competition
- **Revenue optimization** via mathematical and ML-based methods
- **Real-time simulation** and visualization for business impact assessment

---

### Background
The global hotel market exceeds **$1.3 trillion**, with increasing adoption of **dynamic pricing** by major hotel chains and OTAs.  
Building a flexible, API-first, ML-driven pricing engine represents a major opportunity both for industry players and as a standalone service offering.

Inspired by companies building real-time, data-driven marketplaces, this project demonstrates how such a system can be designed and implemented for the travel and hospitality sector.
